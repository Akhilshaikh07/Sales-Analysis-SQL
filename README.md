# SQL Sales Analysis Project  

# Project Objective
The goal of this project was to analyze retail sales data using only SQL to derive business insights.
Key objectives included:
Identifying sales trends over time
Understanding customer segmentation and purchase behavior
Evaluating product performance compared to averages and previous years
Measuring contribution of categories to overall sales
Building a consolidated Customer Report with KPIs

# SQL Concepts Used
Joins (INNER JOIN, USING)
Aggregations (SUM, COUNT, AVG, MIN, MAX)
Window Functions (ROW_NUMBER, RANK, LAG, LEAD, OVER)
Common Table Expressions (CTE with WITH)
Date Functions (YEAR, MONTH, TIMESTAMPDIFF, DATEDIFF)
Conditional Logic (CASE WHEN)
NULL & Blank Handling (COALESCE, IFNULL)
Views for reusable analysis

# Business Problems Solved

1 Sales Performance Over Time
Analyzed monthly and yearly sales trends
Measured total sales, customers, and quantity growth
2 Cumulative & Moving Analysis
Calculated running total of sales
Derived moving average of sales per year
3 Product Performance Analysis
Compared each product’s sales to:
Its average performance
Previous year’s sales (YoY Growth %)
Classified products as Above Avg / Below Avg
 4 Category Contribution
Identified top contributing product categories
Calculated % share of each category in total sales
5 Customer Segmentation
Segmented customers into VIP, Regular, New
VIP → >12 months + >5000 total spend
Regular → >12 months + <=5000 spend
New → <12 months histor
6 Customer Report (Portfolio-Ready)
Consolidated customer metrics:
Name, Age & Age Group
Total Orders, Total Sales, Total Products Purchased
Average Order Value & Avg. Monthly Spend
Created a reusable SQL View for reporting


# Business Impact
